# Weather-Capstone

# Background
"Nice weather we're having". "It's supposed to snow all day tomorrow". Weather comes up all the time in conversation. Especially in a place like Colorado where the weather can drastically change over the couse of a week. I was interested in looking into weather data to identify patterns and trends. 



# Data
I started by working with a dataset that contains roughly 5 years of hourly measurements of various weather attributes from 30 U.S. and Canadian cities.
